The public key is only for beaconing location reports, which can be decrypted by a private key.
It is not used for beaconing data.

To generate the public key and its private key:
1. Run: provision/genkey.py
2. Open output/something.keys, copy down the advertisement key.
3. Run: echo -n "advertisement key" | base64 -d | hexdump -C
Then copy down the 28 bytes of hexdump output below:
